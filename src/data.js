We solve problems at scale so they never happen again. At our best, we solve problems before they happen. How?</div><h3>We Believe That</h3><div>-- Invisible is a world-changing company and the Operation Team is responsible for creating the systems that will launch Invisible into the stratosphere</div><div>-- Exponential gains from systems  Short term linear work  Systems for system's sake</div><div>-- Consistent feedback is key - we are addicted to learning and getting better</div><div>-- What one of us knows, all of us should know</div><div>-- Every new mistake is a learning opportunity</div><h3>Because of these beliefs, we’ve built a team where</h3><div>-- Distributed approaches and centralized intelligence merge. Each teammate is constantly innovating and trying something new. Every mistake is prevented by all. Every success is learned by all.</div><div>-- Each of us contains the sum of the knowledge, intelligence, and creativity of our entire team.</div><div>-- We evolve and mutate constantly like an organism, identifying successful and problematic tactics and incorporating ideas from any source.</div><h3>What is an Agent?</h3><div>An <strong>Agent</strong> is a member of Invisible’s elite workforce.</div><h3>Who are the Agents?</h3><div>Invisible’s agents are an international group of passionate, restless humans striving to constantly grow, learn, and build a better future for themselves and the world.</div><h3>An agent is… </h3><ul>\n<li>a father in the Philippines, providing for his whole family. </li>\n<li>a college student in Kenya, searching for a bright future. </li>\n<li>a stay-at-home mom in Texas, desiring to learn but constrained at home. </li>\n<li>a high school student in Ohio, frustrated by a dysfunctional school system. </li>\n<li>a bachelor in Poland, seeking to both work and learn.</li>\n</ul><div>An agent is <strong>you</strong>.</div><h3>What do Operators do?</h3><div>The Operator is the starting position of Invisible’s Agents. Operators are the frontline of the Digital Assembly Line. As its name implies, the operator operates. They are the infantry that makes up most of our workforce, doing work for clients, executing Process instructions, and organizing data.</div><h3>Operates processes.</h3><div>An operator reads the instructions of a process and operates them to accomplish work for a client.</div><ul>\n<li>Example: an operator will read these instructions (screenshot) to send a legal agreement. </li>\n</ul><h3>Assigned to a prime.</h3><div>A prime is a group of processes. An operator is assigned to a Prime, or a series of primes, to gain expertise in related processes. In a prime, an operator will interact closely with the Manager and other operators of that prime.</div><ul>\n<li>Example: an operator assigned to the Calendar prime will do processes like “Scheduling a Meeting”, “Sending a Reminder”, “Sending a Daily Agenda”, etc.</li>\n</ul><h3>Communicates with clients.</h3><div>An operator will communicate to the client according to the instructions of a process. Much of this communication is templated in a process, but it will stray from the instructions from time-to-time and the operator will need to create a unique response. When communicating to a client, an operator will have to write in the voice of the client’s synthetic Assistant, and not in the operator’s own voice.</div><ul>\n<li>Example: John Keats is the assistant for client Francis Pedraza. When responding to Francis, the operator will have to be communicating in the voice of John Keats.</li>\n</ul><h3>Gives feedback.</h3><div>An operator gives feedback on process instructions to other agents, who upgrades the process based on that feedback. This feedback can be proactive from the operator seeing potential improvements, or reactive from the operator making an implicit mistake that can be avoided with clearer instructions.</div><ul>\n<li>Proactive Example: an operator realizes that two steps involving navigating a website can be consolidated into one step, with a link leading to the desired destination. The operator will give the builder constructive feedback and offer a suggestion on how to upgrade the process.</li>\n<li>Reactive Example: an operator uses the wrong format to name a calendar event, but it was never stated to use that format in the process. The operator will then let the builder know of this mistake and offer a suggestion on how to upgrade the process.</li>\n</ul><h3>Tracks time.</h3><div>An operator tracks the time it takes for them to operate an instance of a specific process. </div><h3>Tracks work.</h3><div>An operator tracks every instance of process operation for a specific client in the client’s dashboard—located in a Google Sheet. The operator also logs any mistake they make and any preference the client sets.</div><ul>\n<li>Example: an operator will track the name of the prime, process, and specific instance, along with start and end dates, and the minutes it took to complete the instance.</li>\n<li>This position is constantly monitored for new applicants and a member of our hiring team will reach out once there is a new project available. This may take some time, however, once a project begins we will reach out to you to begin the hiring process.</li>\n</ul><div>$6.50/ hour <strong>(Please note it is result based pay not hourly)</strong>\n</div><p>Originally posted on <a href='https://himalayas.app'>Himalayas</a></p>",

That’s not all though - they’d equally be invited to improve our documentation, help build out more efficient support processes in our <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/issues/\">issue tracker</a> and dive into the cutting edge technologies that will define how we will do work tomorrow.</p><p>At <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/gitlab\">GitLab</a>, we hold that <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#no-matrix-organization\">management should be technically competent and experienced in the subject matter</a>.

That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards.

Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.</p>\n<p>We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/wave\">Wave</a>. In November 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. <br>In 2019, we expanded to Cote d'Ivoire.

Please keep reading...</h3>\n<p>You’ve probably heard the following <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified\">statistic:</a> Most male applicants only meet 60% of the qualifications, while women and other marginalized candidates only apply if they meet 100% of the qualifications. If <strong>you</strong> think you have what it takes but don’t meet every single point in the job description, please apply! </p>\n<p>We believe that historically, many processes disproportionately hurt the most marginalized communities in society- including people of color, working-class backgrounds, women and LGBTQ people. Centering these communities at our core is pivotal for any successful organization and a value we uphold steadfastly.  Therefore, <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/udacity\">Udacity</a> strongly encourages applications from all communities and backgrounds. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/udacity\">Udacity</a> is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer.

We believe that the unique contributions of all Udacians is the driver of our success.To ensure that our products and culture continue to incorporate everyone's perspectives and experience we never discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, ancestry, disability, medical condition (including genetic information), age, veteran status or military status, denial of pregnancy disability leave or reasonable accommodation.</p>\n<p>As part of our ongoing work to build more diverse teams at <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/udacity\">Udacity</a>, when applying, you will be asked to complete a voluntary self-identification survey. This survey is anonymous, we are unable to connect your application with your survey responses.

We address the complex dynamic of workforce challenges and strive to be the change we need in the world to transform talent to create opportunities for heightened productivity and retention. <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/udacity\">Udacity</a> is where lifelong learners come to learn the skills they need, to land the jobs they want, and to build the lives they deserve.</p>\n<h3>Don’t stop there!  Please keep reading...</h3>\n<p>You’ve probably heard the following <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified\">statistic:</a> Most male applicants only meet 60% of the qualifications, while women and other marginalized candidates only apply if they meet 100% of the qualifications. If <strong>you</strong> think you have what it takes but don’t meet every single point in the job description, please apply! </p>\n<p>We believe that historically, many processes disproportionately hurt the most marginalized communities in society- including people of color, working-class backgrounds, women and LGBTQ people. Centering these communities at our core is pivotal for any successful organization and a value we uphold steadfastly.  Therefore, <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/udacity\">Udacity</a> strongly encourages applications from all communities and backgrounds. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/udacity\">Udacity</a> is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer. Please read our blog post for <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/blog/2022/06/6-reasons-why-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-the-workplace-exists.html\">“6 Reasons Why Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the Workplace Exists”</a></p>\n<h3>Last, but certainly not least…</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/udacity\">Udacity</a> is committed to creating economic empowerment and a more diverse and equitable world. We believe that the unique contributions of all Udacians is the driver of our success.To ensure that our products and culture continue to incorporate everyone's perspectives and experience we never discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, ancestry, disability, medical condition (including genetic information), age, veteran status or military status, denial of pregnancy disability leave or reasonable accommodation.</p>\n<p>As part of our ongoing work to build more diverse teams at <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/udacity\">Udacity</a>, when applying, you will be asked to complete a voluntary self-identification survey. This survey is anonymous, we are unable to connect your application with your survey responses. Please complete this voluntary survey as we utilize the data for diversity measures in terms of gender and ethnic background in both our candidates and our Udacians. We consider this data seriously and appreciate your willingness to complete this step in the process, if you choose to do so.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIuXj9CDo0wfeature=youtu.be\"><strong>Learn more about <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/udacity\">Udacity</a>'s Values</strong></a></div>\n<div>\n<strong>Students First</strong> - <strong>Better Together</strong> - <strong>Entrepreneurial</strong> - <strong>Data Driven</strong> - <strong>Candid and Direct</strong> - <strong>Talent Obsessed</strong>\n</div>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/legal/privacy\"></a><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/udacity\">Udacity</a>'s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy</div>\n</div><p>Originally posted on <a href='https://himalayas.app'>Himalayas</a></p>",
